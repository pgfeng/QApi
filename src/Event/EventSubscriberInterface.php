     * Returns an array of event names this subscriber wants to listen to.

     * The array keys are event names and the value can be:
     *
     *  * The method name to call (priority defaults to 0)
     *  * An array composed of the method name to call and the priority
     *  * An array of arrays composed of the method names to call and respective
     *    priorities, or 0 if unset
     *
     * For instance:
     *
     *  * ['eventName' => 'methodName']
     *  * ['eventName' => ['methodName', $priority]]
     *  * ['eventName' => [['methodName1', $priority], ['methodName2']]]

     * All logic depending on runtime state must be put into the individual methods handling the events.

     * @return array<string, string|array{0: string, 1: int}|list<array{0: string, 1?: int}>>
